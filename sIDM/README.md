"sIDM_code.Rmd" is the main markdown file for data manipulation, conducting simulation study, and fitting American robin and brook trout integrated distribution models. 

"algorithms" contains hard-coded MCMC algorithms with Pólya-gamma augmentation and stan files for facilitating model fitting with HMC. These algorithms and files are referenced in "sIDM_code.Rmd"

"Outputs" is referenced in "sIDM_code.Rmd" for storage and retrieval. We provide the results of the simulation study for convenience.  

"Kery_2024" contains data and code for fitting the integrated distance sampling model described in Kéry et al. (2025) (see https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4292).
The files are provided here again for convenience but are also publicly archived at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10666980) 

Raw data for the brook trout analysis is not provided because of data privacy. Summarized data files for fitting the described integrated distribution model will be provided upon request.
